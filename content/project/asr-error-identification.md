**Project Title** : Speech-To-Text Error Analyzer 
**Skill**: Python, Flask
**Toolkit**: CMUSphinx, nltk, numpy
**Summary** :

- Built a Flask front end to corporate with recognition application for speech recognition and text analyzation by
getting recognition files from user and posting classification result
- Combined the ASR application with n-gram and word error rate to do speech-driven text error classification with a goal to detect and improve common mistake

### Purpose 

Speech to Text, or Automatic Speech Recognition, is a process to convert human speech to a corresponding set of words. Currently, there are some well-established speech recognition systems such as Microsoft, Wake-Up-Word, Google, and CMU Sphinx. 
Yet, there aren’t many evaluation tools to analyse and categorize different word errors. 

Taken the following word error rate as an example (from my current intern research):

> REF (reference) :  who had__vanished 
HYP (hypothesis) :    ___ would vanish   
EVA (evaluation) :    D   _S___S                             
WER(word error rate): 17.65%

In this case, "who" has been deleted from the reference sentences and "has" is substituted by "would", and "vanished" is substituted by "vanish". (D for delete, S for substitute) 

### Speech-to-Text Error Analyzer
- The **goal/function of this tool**: is to list types of errors. For instance, 
> D S combination cover \_\_ % of error from this recognizer performance.
> \_\_ % D S combination is due to two words mixing together
> S is \_\_ % of all the error
> \_\_ % is due to inflections, \_\_  % is a spelling mistake, and \_\_ % is determiner substitute.

### Common Errors
1. **Inflection, Homophone**
Inflection might be caused by the missing suffixes in the phonetics dictionary. 
And homophone can be either the speaker's error or recognition error.

2. **Split or merge**
- hyphens: sometimes when we recognize the word correctly, it was marked as incorrect because of a missing or extra hyphens.
- numbers to words: the ASR can recognize the number but only output number in words format. It can cause the wrong alignment during the evaluation and lower the word error rate.

### SR/TF-IDF Independent Study Proposal
I am working on a further improvement from the SR-ANLZ project. 
The goal is to combine text information with word error rate with TF-IDF approaches. Since errors on common words like "the" might not be as bad as errors on rare/important words, we can adjust our evaluation parameters.
Another factor is length normalizer. If two recognition text has the same amount of error word, the one which has a longer passage length should still have a higher performance score.

### Mentor Point of View
- adapt the best result from the different speech recognition
- adapt the word correction?
- grammar autocorrect?

### Question?
- Will it be useful?
I think it can be useful because it highlights the kind of mistake in details. It's like human learn from mistakes.

### Possible Output
- Adapt the formula, f(q,d) = &sum;w&in;q&and;d c(w,q)x (k+1)c(w,d)/(c(w,d)+k(1-b+b x|d|/avdl)) x log ((M+1)/df(w))
- Query is the error words 
- Output the following:

|term|df|idf|
|----|----|---|
|car|18165| 1.65|
|auto| 6725|2.08|
|..|..|..|
