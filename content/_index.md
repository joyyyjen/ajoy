#About This Website <br>
把四處瞧瞧給搬過來了。至今我還在東張西望的看看寫寫，寫些語言學，分享留學，跟整理project 和報告。
這個部落格可以是我的學習筆記，可以是分享留學經驗的通道，更可以是你們發現新知識的地方！


# Hi! I am Joy
### Professional Introduction
I am a senior at UIUC majoring in Linguistics, with a minor in Computer Science. My interest and concentration is natural language processing (NLP). I am currently applying for both graduate school and am looking for jobs related to text processing, information retrieval, or linguistic analysis. I’ve had internships in semantics annotation at Glossika, a company that provides language acquisition strategies for beginner and advanced language learner. I am currently interning on campus for NCSA SPIN program. The topic of my intern research is Speech-to-Text Auto Captioning. 

In addition, I am one of the co-presidents in Taiwanese Student Association at UIUC. I am supervising public relation, marketing, technology, corporate, and graduate departments.
