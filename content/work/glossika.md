### Job Description

**Employer** : Glossika

- A company that provides language acquisition strategies for beginner and advanced language
learner, and offers AI-based platform to speed fluency.

**Project Title** : Role and Reference Grammar Annotation 

**Summary** :

- Tagged syntactic and semantics features based on role and reference grammar 
- Cooperated with a software developer to build a syntactically tagged corpus aiming at AI training and testing on language learning at different levels 

**Skill**: Knowledgeable in semantics, syntax, Regex
**Toolkit**: Excel, google Spread Sheet

As my first linguist's relevant job, it indeed gave me a new perspective. After this internship experience and my introductory and upper-level coursework, I found an interest in natural language processing.
The task is mostly about thematic/semantic role labeling. And its theoretical framework is based on Role and Reference Grammar.

### Thematic/Semantic Role Labeling:
Thematic relations, also known as semantic roles, are the various roles that a noun phrase may play with respect to the action or state of its governing verb. 
The major thematics relation is listed below: 

**Bill** (Agent) sang a beautiful song. **I** (experiencer) cried.

- **Agent**: One who performs the action. Bill is the Agent. 
- ** Experiencer**: the entity that receives sensory or emotional input.

Luke cut the cake with a **knife** (Instrument)
I put **the book**(theme) **on the table** (location)
The falling rocks crushed **Adam's car** (patient) on his way **to school** (direction)
The rockets was launched **from China** (source)

- **Theme**:  undergoes the action but does not change its stage
- **Patient**: undergoes the action and changes it state
- **Instrument**: used to carry out the action
- **Location**: where the action occurs
- **Direction**: where the action is directed towards
- **Source**: where the action originated 

I sent **Alice** (recipient) a Christmas gift.  
I fight **for the king** (beneficiary)

- **Recipient**: a special kind of goal associated with verbs expressing a change in ownership
- **Beneficiary**: who benefit from the action.

Andrew called 911 **in order to get some help** (purpose)
Sean ate the cake **because he was hungry**

- **Purpose**: the reason for which an action is performed
- **Cause**: what caused the action to occur

Once we have deal with noun phrase, let's return to verb.

### The Lexical Semantics of Verb
The semantic representation of a sentence is based on the lexical representation of the verb or other predicating element
Based on Vendler's theory of *Aktionsart*, there are four basic classes: state, achievement, accomplishment and activity

### Recall Natural Language Processing

Text data are in natural languages. So computers have to understand natural languages to some extent, in order to make use of the data.
